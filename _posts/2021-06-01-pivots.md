Now that I've finally wrapped up school, I've had nothing but time on my hands. Time to apply for jobs (hello, potential employers!) and time to reflect on what I want this space to become, grow into, and so on. While the original intent for this site was for it to be strictly professional-facing, I think that's not an authentic expression of myself. I'm more than just projects and work! So I want to pivot to more of a genuine blog (whatever that may be). So look out for a) more posts in general and b) some non-math, non-data science posts. In particular, I've been tremendously inspired by my friend Charlie T (you can find his stuff online at [charlietrochlil.com](https://www.charlietrochlil.com/)) and I want to try to explore more of what this platform can mean, rather than just trying to flex online (plenty of that, too, don't worry). There's probably another post coming down the pipeline tonight, actually. So I hope we can find something enw on this journey together.

Cheers!
